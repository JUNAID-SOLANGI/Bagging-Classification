### **Classification Performance Report: Raisin Dataset Analysis**

**Date:** June 25, 2025

**1. Introduction**

This report presents a comparative analysis of two machine learning models – a Support Vector Classifier (SVC) and a Voting Classifier (an ensemble method) – applied to a dataset containing features of raisins, aiming to classify them into "Besni" or "Kecimen" varieties. The objective is to evaluate the performance of each model and understand their strengths and weaknesses in classifying these two types of raisins.

**2. Dataset Overview**

The dataset consists of various geometric properties of raisins, including:
* `Area`
* `MajorAxisLength`
* `MinorAxisLength`
* `Eccentricity`
* `ConvexArea`
* `Extent`
* `Perimeter`

The target variable is `Class`, which categorizes the raisins as either "Besni" or "Kecimen".

For the SVC model's evaluation, the test set contained 180 samples, with a class distribution of 86 "Besni" and 94 "Kecimen" raisins.
For the Voting Classifier, the test set contained 40 samples, with a class distribution of 19 samples for class '0' (likely "Besni") and 21 samples for class '1' (likely "Kecimen").

**3. Model Architectures**

* **Support Vector Classifier (SVC):** A single SVC model was employed, likely with a Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel, which is a common and effective choice for capturing non-linear relationships in data.

* **Voting Classifier (Ensemble Model):** This model combines the predictions of three individual base estimators:
    * **Logistic Regression (`log_model`):** A linear model often used as a baseline for classification.
    * **Support Vector Classifier (`svc_model`):** Another SVC model, similar to the standalone one, contributing its non-linear classification capabilities.
    * **Decision Tree Classifier (`dt_model`):** A tree-based model known for its ability to capture complex decision rules.
    The `VotingClassifier` was configured with `voting='hard'`, meaning it makes predictions based on the majority vote of its constituent classifiers.

**4. Performance Evaluation**

The performance of both models was evaluated using standard classification metrics: Precision, Recall, F1-score, and Accuracy.

**4.1. SVC Model Results**

The SVC model was evaluated on a test set of 180 samples.

| Class     | Precision | Recall | F1-score | Support |
| :-------- | :-------- | :----- | :------- | :------ |
| **Besni** | 0.88      | 0.79   | 0.83     | 86      |
| **Kecimen** | 0.83      | 0.90   | 0.86     | 94      |
| **Accuracy**| **0.85** |        |          | **180** |
| Macro Avg | 0.85      | 0.85   | 0.85     | 180     |
| Weighted Avg| 0.85      | 0.85   | 0.85     | 180     |

**Analysis of SVC Results:**
* **Overall Accuracy:** The SVC model achieved a solid accuracy of **85%**.
* **"Besni" Class:** The model demonstrates good precision (0.88), meaning when it predicts a raisin is "Besni," it's correct 88% of the time. Its recall for "Besni" is slightly lower (0.79), indicating it identifies 79% of all actual "Besni" raisins.
* **"Kecimen" Class:** For "Kecimen," the model shows strong recall (0.90), successfully identifying 90% of actual "Kecimen" raisins. Its precision (0.83) is good, though slightly lower than "Besni" precision.
* **Balance:** The F1-scores (0.83 for "Besni" and 0.86 for "Kecimen") suggest a relatively balanced performance across both classes, with a slight edge in identifying "Kecimen" due to higher recall.

**4.2. Voting Classifier Results**

The Voting Classifier was evaluated on a test set of 40 samples. Note: The class labels "0" and "1" in this report are assumed to correspond to "Besni" and "Kecimen" respectively, based on the similar performance pattern to the SVC report.

| Class     | Precision | Recall | F1-score | Support |
| :-------- | :-------- | :----- | :------- | :------ |
| **0** | 0.88      | 0.79   | 0.83     | 19      |
| **1** | 0.83      | 0.90   | 0.86     | 21      |
| **Accuracy**| **0.85** |        |          | **40** |
| Macro Avg | 0.85      | 0.85   | 0.85     | 40      |
| Weighted Avg| 0.85      | 0.85   | 0.85     | 40      |

**Analysis of Voting Classifier Results:**
* **Overall Accuracy:** The Voting Classifier also achieved an accuracy of **85%**.
* **Per-Class Performance:** Interestingly, the per-class precision, recall, and F1-scores are identical to those of the standalone SVC model, assuming class '0' is 'Besni' and class '1' is 'Kecimen'.
    * Class '0' (Besni): Precision 0.88, Recall 0.79, F1-score 0.83
    * Class '1' (Kecimen): Precision 0.83, Recall 0.90, F1-score 0.86
* **Test Set Size:** It's important to note that this evaluation was performed on a much smaller test set (40 samples) compared to the SVC (180 samples).

**5. Comparative Analysis**

* **Accuracy:** Both the standalone SVC model and the Voting Classifier achieved the **exact same overall accuracy of 85%**.
* **Per-Class Metrics:** Remarkably, the per-class precision, recall, and F1-scores are also identical between the two models. This suggests that in this specific instance and with the given test sets, the ensemble did not significantly improve upon the performance of its presumably well-tuned SVC component.
* **Robustness and Test Set Size:** A crucial difference is the size of the test sets. The SVC model's performance was validated on 180 samples, while the Voting Classifier's performance was on only 40 samples. The results on a larger test set (SVC) are generally more reliable and representative of the model's true generalization ability. The identical performance on a much smaller test set for the Voting Classifier might be a coincidence or an indication that the individual SVC model within the ensemble is largely dominating the voting process, or that the other models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree) did not add enough diverse predictive power to alter the outcome significantly, especially with hard voting.

**6. Conclusion and Recommendations**

Based on the provided evaluation metrics:

* Both the SVC and the Voting Classifier demonstrate **strong performance** in classifying raisin types, achieving 85% accuracy.
* In this specific comparison, the **Voting Classifier did not show an improvement over the standalone SVC model's performance**. This could be due to:
    * The `voting='hard'` strategy, which only considers the predicted labels, rather than probabilities.
    * The strong performance of the individual SVC model within the ensemble already.
    * The other base estimators (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree) not providing enough complementary strengths.
    * The smaller test set used for the Voting Classifier evaluation making it harder to discern subtle differences in performance.

**Recommendations for further investigation:**

1.  **Consistent Test Set:** Re-evaluate both models on the *same* test set of 180 samples to enable a direct and fair comparison.
2.  **Soft Voting:** Experiment with `voting='soft'` for the `VotingClassifier` (requires base estimators to have `predict_proba` method, like `SVC(probability=True)`), which often leads to better performance by leveraging the confidence scores of the individual models.
3.  **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Ensure all individual models (`log_model`, `svc_model`, `dt_model`) within the Voting Classifier are optimally tuned, as their individual strengths contribute to the ensemble's overall performance.
4.  **Ensemble Diversity:** If the Voting Classifier still doesn't improve, consider adjusting the type or hyperparameters of the base estimators to promote greater diversity among them.
5.  **Visualizations:** Create confusion matrices and potentially decision boundary plots (if data can be reduced to 2D) for both models to gain deeper insights into their misclassifications.
